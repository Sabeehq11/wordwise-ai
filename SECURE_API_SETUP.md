# 🔒 Secure OpenAI API Key Setup

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE FIXED

Your OpenAI API key was previously exposed in your client-side code. This meant anyone could:
- View your API key in browser developer tools
- Extract and misuse your API key
- Rack up charges on your OpenAI account

## ✅ New Secure Architecture

I've implemented a secure backend using Firebase Cloud Functions:

1. **Client-side**: No more API keys exposed
2. **Server-side**: API key stored securely in Firebase
3. **Secure communication**: Your app calls your Firebase Function, which calls OpenAI

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Your OpenAI API Key in Firebase

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key as a Firebase secret
firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

When prompted, enter your actual OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`).

### Step 2: Deploy Firebase Functions

```bash
# Deploy your secure backend
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Step 3: Update Your Project

The client-side code has been updated to use the secure backend. Your app now calls:
- `https://us-central1-wordwiseai-15b77.cloudfunctions.net/grammarCheck`

Instead of directly calling OpenAI.

### Step 4: Remove Old Environment Variables

You can now safely remove these from any `.env` files:
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (this was the security risk)

### Step 5: Test Your Secure Setup

```bash
# Test the secure connection
npm run dev
```

Visit your app and try the grammar checker. You should see:
- ✅ Grammar checking works
- 🔒 No API keys in browser developer tools
- 💚 Console logs showing "Checking grammar securely"

## 🔍 How to Verify Security

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Sources tab**
3. **Search for "sk-"** (OpenAI API key prefix)
4. **Result should be**: No API keys found ✅

## 🏗️ What Changed

### Backend (Firebase Functions)
- ✅ Secure API key storage using Firebase Secrets
- ✅ Server-side OpenAI API calls
- ✅ Proper error handling and timeouts
- ✅ CORS enabled for your frontend

### Frontend
- ✅ New `secureGrammarService.js` that calls your backend
- ✅ Updated `GrammarContext.jsx` to use secure service
- ✅ Removed direct OpenAI API calls
- ✅ Better error messages

## 💰 Cost Benefits

- **Before**: Anyone could steal and abuse your API key
- **After**: Only your authorized app can use your API key
- **Result**: Protected from unauthorized usage and unexpected charges

## 🚨 Emergency: If Your Old Key Was Compromised

1. **Go to OpenAI Dashboard**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Revoke the old key** immediately
3. **Generate a new key**
4. **Set the new key** using `firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. **Redeploy** with `firebase deploy --only functions`

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The secure service includes:
- ✅ Longer timeouts for mobile networks
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for poor connections
- ✅ Network status detection

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Grammar service connection failed"
```bash
# Check Firebase Functions logs
firebase functions:log --only grammarCheck
```

### "Firebase Functions not deployed"
```bash
# Redeploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### "OpenAI API error"
Check that your API key is set correctly:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:access OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## 🎉 You're Now Secure!

Your OpenAI API key is now:
- 🔒 **Hidden** from client-side code
- 🛡️ **Protected** on Firebase servers
- 🚀 **Fast** with optimized backend calls
- 💰 **Safe** from unauthorized usage

The grammar checking functionality remains exactly the same for users, but now it's secure!
